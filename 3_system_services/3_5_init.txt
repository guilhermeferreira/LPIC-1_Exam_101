SystemV init

Replaced by upstart, then systemd.

Release by AT&T in 1983.

Last Linux distributions to use init.
- Ubuntu 6.06 (2006).
- Fedora 8 (2007).
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (2007).
- OpenSUSE 11.2 (2009).
- Debian Wheezy (2013).

Initialization process:
1. Kernel runs /sbin/init
2. Init loads /etc/inittab.
3. Inittab configures...
   3.1. Default runlevel.
   3.2. Control-Al-Del behavior.
   3.3. Executes links in /etc/rc.d/rc.<runlevel>
4. Runlevel scripts start services.

Runlevel is a system configuration profile. There're 7 runlevels total:
- Runlevel 0: halt.
- Runlevel 1: single-user mode. Without password, and without network.
- Runlevel 2: multi-user mode. Loggin woth many users, but without network.
- Runlevel 3: multi-user mode with networking. Fully fnctional command-line system.
- Runlevel 4: undefined.
- Runlevel 5: multi-user mode with networking and GUI. <= Common for Desktop
- Runlevel 6: reboot. All services are stoped, and the system reboots.

Start a service with SystemV init:
  $ /etc/init.d/<service> start
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd start

Stop a service with SystemV init:
  $ /etc/init.d/<service> stop
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd stop

Restart, reload, and status a service with SysV init:
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd restart
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd reload
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd status

Red Hat has the 'service' command, which is like the /etc/init.d/ scripts
  $ service httpd start
  $ /etc/init.d/httpd start

Change the runlevel
  $ init <runlevel>

Change the runlevel to reboot. The OS will boot and reboot continuously.
  $ init 6
