Systemd manages objects like services, devices, timers, and so on.
Systemd objects are called units.


List systemd units:
  $ systemctl list-unit-files

STATE are
- enabled: starting on boot.
- diabled: not starting on boot, but can be enabled.
- static: not enabled. 

List (service) file units:
  $ systemctl list-unit-files -at <unit>
  $ systemctl list-unit-files -at service

List running (service) units:
  $ systemctl list-units -at <unit>
  $ systemctl list-units -at service

Show the unit file of a given (service) unit (e.g. system service)
  $ systemctl cat <unit>
  $ systemctl cat rsyslog

Show the status of a given unit (e.g. system service)
  $ systemctl status <unit>
  $ systemctl status rsyslog
