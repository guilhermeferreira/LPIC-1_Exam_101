Linux has two programs to find files: locate(1) and find(1).

The locate(1) command uses a database created by updatedb(1) to locate the file
that match a pattern.

  $ locate <pattern>
  $ locate *.png

Using extended regular expressions

  $ locate --regex '^/[a-z]+/bash$'
  /bin/bash

Updating the database.

  $ sudo updatedb

Showing the database information.

  $ locate -S
