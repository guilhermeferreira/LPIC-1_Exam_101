The locate(1) is database driven, while find(1) always search for files in the
filesystem. The locate(1) command is faster, but find(1) is more reliable once
its results are always up-to-date.

  $ find <path> -name <file/pattern>
  $ find /bin -name bash
  /bin/bash

Find files belonging to a specific user.

  $ find <path> -user <user>
  $ find /bin -user root

Find files belonging to a specific group.

  $ find <path> -group <group>
  $ find /bin -group admin

Find files with a specific size.

  $ find <path> -size <size>
  $ find /bin -size +1M
  /bin/bash
  /bin/systemctl
  $ ls -lh /bin/bash /bin/systemctl
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1.2M Aug  4  2021 /bin/bash
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1.1M Mar 20  2022 /bin/systemctl

Execute another command on each entry found.

  $ find <path> -exec <comand>
  $ find /bin -size +1M -exec stat -c "%s %n" {} \;
  /bin/bash
  /bin/systemctl

Find files by modification date. The -mtime finds files modified, and +mtime not
modified. Where time is N*24 hours (e.g. -mtime 1 is 1 day).

  $ find <path> -mtime <N>
  $ find <path> +mtime <N>

Find files by type. Where TYPE is 'f' for regular files, 'd' for directories,
'p' for named pipes, etc.

  $ find <path> -type <type>
