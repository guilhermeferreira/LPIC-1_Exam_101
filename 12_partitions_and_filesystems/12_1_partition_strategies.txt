  Hard-drive partitioning strategies
---------------------------------------

- BIOS partitions.
  - Recognized by the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) boot firmware.
  - Store partition tables in the MBR (Master Boot Record).
  - Managed by fdisk(8) tool.
  - Legacy systems.
  - Primary partition is bootable by the BIOS (i.e. BIOS can only boot an
    operating system stored in a primary partition).
  - Limited to 4 (four) primary partitions to work around this limitation, one
    primary partition becomes an extended partition.
  - Extended partition contains logical drives (i.e. software partitions).
  - Cannot boot from a logica drive.
  - Primary/extended partitions have names from 1 to 4.
  - Logical partitions have names from 5 to 11.
  - Acessible size of 2 TB (terabyte)

- UEFI partitions.
  - Recognized by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) boot firmware.
  - Store partition tables in the GPT (GUID Partition Table).
  - Managed by the gdisk(8) tool.
  - Modern systems.
  - No four-partition limit.
  - No need for logical drives.
  - Older systems will not recognized GUID partitions.
  - Partitions must be contiguous.
  - Partitions cannot be resized.
  - Acessible size of 18 EB (exabyte).

- Logical Volume Management (LVM).
  - Abstraction layer above real partitions or disks.
  - Combine partitions or disks.
  - Can resize or move drives.
  - Create redundant arrays.
  - Span volumes across multiple disks.
  - Can encrypt drives.
