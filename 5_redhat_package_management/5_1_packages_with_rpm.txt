Red-Hat Package Management (RPM)

Videos:
- RPM software management overview.
- Query packages with RPM.

---------------------------------------

RPM manages the installation of individual packages using YUM as dependency and
repository manager. It performs the same task as DPKG in Debian.
- Installs packages.
- Downloads packages from FTP, but not from repositories.

YUM manages repositories. It performs the same task as APT in Debian.
- YUM uses RPM to install packages on Red-Hat like distributions.
- YUM resolves dependencies automatically.
- YUM has the concept of software package groups, which are software installed together.
- YUM repositories have RPM packages.

---------------------------------------

The package information can come from the database (use only -q), or directly
from the file (use -qp, 'p' from package).

Query all packages. The 'q' from query.
  $ rpm -qa

Query the database for package information.
  $ rpm -qi <package name>

  $ rpm -qc <package name>

Find the package that owns the file.
  $ rpm -qf <file>

List the documentation from a package.
  $ rpm -qd <package name>

  $ rpm -qdf <file>

  $ sudo yum install -y <package name>
