Debian Package Tools is used by distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and
Linux Mint.

---------------------------------------

dpkg manages installation of individual packages using APT as a dependency
and repository manager.

Package Management tool is dpkg, which is equivalent to rpm in Red Hat.
  dpkg (Debian) = rpm (Red Hat)

Repository Management tool is APT, which is equivalent to DNF in Red Hat.
  apt (Debian) = yum/dnf (Red Hat)

This means that, dpkg manages downloaded packages (i.e. package files),
whereas apt manages packages in the repository. Also, apt uses dpkg to
install a package once it downloads it.

---------------------------------------

Check if a package is installed or not.
  $ apt search <package name>

Query the database for package information. Remote package details.
  $ apt show <package name>

  $ dpkg -I <package file>.deb
  $ dpkg --info <package file>.deb

  $ sudo dpkg -i <package file>.deb
  $ sudo dpkg --install <package file>.deb

List the package's files that are going to be installed.
  $ dpkg -c <package file>.deb
