Kernel Space
- Privileged.
- Full access to hardware.
- Runs in ring 0 (hardware-enforced privilege execution mode).
User Space
- Unprivileged.
- Cannot access hardware directly.
- Runs in ring 3 (interact with hardware by making system calls to the kernel).

Hardware plug-in process
1. Device is attached
2. Kernel populates information in /sys (the sysfs virtual filesystem).
3. Kernel sends a device event to the 'udev' user-space tool.
4. udev reads the rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/.
5. udev creates device nodes in /dev (the virtual filesystem).
6. udev notifies the 'dbus' user-space tool.

Monitor udev messages
$ sudo udevadm monitor

Monitor D-Bus messages
