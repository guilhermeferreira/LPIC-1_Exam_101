Cloud Computing = the automatic and dynamic scaling of computer resources (e.g.
                  storage space, CPU cycles, database, networking).
- IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service. Provides hardware.
- PaaS = Platform as a Service. Provides operating system.
- SaaS = Software as a Service. Provides application.

Emulation = translates every instruction. Can emulate one type of CPU into another.
            For example, run a ARM software on a x86 machine.
            QEMU perform emulation.

Virtualization = the creation of virtual versions of something, specifically
                 computer hardware, storage devices, and network resources.
                 Virtualization doesn't create a different machine, but allocates
                 part of a real machine into a virtual environment.
                 Xen, KVM, VirtualBox and VMWare perform virtualization.

Paravirtualization = software virtualization that DOES NOT virtualize the
                     entire computer.
- DOES require the guest operating system to know it's being virtualized (i.e.
  PV support in the guest kernel), but
- DOES NOT require hardware virtualization support.

Full Virtualization = hardware virtualization that DOES virtualize the entire
                      computer.
- DOES NOT require the guest operating system to know it's being virtualized, but
- DOES require hardware virtualization support.
