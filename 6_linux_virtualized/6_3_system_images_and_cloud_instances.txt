Installing a OS in one VM is simply
1. Download the ISO image.
2. Create the Virtual Machine (VM).
3. Start the VM, booting from the ISO image.
4. Install the Operating System (OS).

However, it becomes time consuming if you have to perform the same steps for
hundreds of machines. So, we can automate VM installation with...

- Kickstart on Red Hat.
    $ sudo cat /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
  Append the file to the kernel command line
    inst.ks=htpp://192.168.0.100/kicjstarts/centos7.bin 

- Preseed on Debian.

- AutoYaST on SUSE.
