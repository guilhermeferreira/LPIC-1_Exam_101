Copy files from <src> to <dst>

  $ cp <src-file> <dst-file>
  $ cp -R <src-dir> <dst-dir>

Useful cp options:

  -a    Archive option preserves all file attributes (ownership, permissions,
        extended attr).

  -b    Backup, which backups the destinations file before overwritting it.

  -n    No clobber prevents overwriting files if they exist.

  -u    Update only moves a file if it's newer than the destination.
