When copy a file, it copies the file's data blocks to a new location on the
disk (using the filesystem).

  $ cp /home/bob/file1.txt /home/ted/file1.txt

When moving a file between different filesystems, it copies the file's data
blocks to the location and deletes the origin data block.

  $ mv /fs1/file1.txt /fs2/file1.txt = cp /fs1/file1.txt /fs2/file1.txt
                                       rm /fs1/file1.txt

When moving a file in the same filesystem, it just pdates the file's location
in the filesystem.

Useful mv options:

  -b    Backup, which backups the destinations file before overwritting it.

  -n    No clobber prevents overwriting files if they exist.

  -u    Update moves a file only if it's newer than the destination.
