 Standard Linux Permissions: features
---------------------------------------

- Users can belong to multiple groups.
- Files and directories belong to one user owner.

- Groups cannot contain other groups.
- Files and directories belong to one group owner.

- Permissions can be set for user, group, and other.
- Other is someone outside the user or the group owner.

- Users can read, write, or execute files.
- Users can list, create new files, and traverse directories.

- Permissions support privilege escalation to the user or group owner of the
  file via SUID (set uid) and SGUI (set gui).
- Permissions support group owner inheritance.

---------------------------------------
 Standard Linux Permissions: shortfalls
---------------------------------------

- Files and directories can have only one user owner.
- Files and directories can have only one group owner.

- Permissions set for other are not concise. We don't know who "other" is. We
  just know it's not the user or goup owner.

- Inheritance only supports group ownership, but not permission inheritance.
- There is no easy way to back up and restore permissions.
- There is no easy way to temporarily restrict permissions.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) remedy these issues.
